Agon light™ is a unique combination of instant-on microcomputer and standalone microcontroller, which allows you to control your projects from the convenience and immediacy of a BASIC prompt, without the need for a host PC or sketch compilation. To find out more about what makes Agon light™ unique, useful and attractive, please visit the official website at: https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/agon.html.<p>
