Agon light™ is a unique combination of instant-on microcomputer and standalone microcontroller, which allows you to control your projects from the convenience and immediacy of a BASIC prompt, without the need for a host PC or sketch compilation. To find out more about what makes Agon light™ unique, useful and attractive, please visit the official website at: https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/agon.html.<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/blob/main/Agon%20light%20R1.0%20Manual.pdf">Manual</a> should also contain everything you need to know.<p>
The three modules of Agon light™'s official firmware, called Quark™, can be found here:

Agon light™ has an <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/235402-agonlight-case">official, customized, 3D-printed case</a>, designed by Jeroen Venema. I recommend that this case for protection and extra mechanical stability.

The directory structure above contains the following information:
<UL>
  <LI><a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/tree/main/3D%20model">/3D Model</a> contains a, well, 3D model of Agon light™'s board and a 2D image specifying the PCB's key dimensions. These are meant for those interested in designing and building custom (3D-printed) cases for Agon light™.
  <LI><a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/tree/main/Design">/Design</a> contains all design files, like schematics, EasyEDA source files and PCB layout.
  <LI><a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/tree/main/Manufacturing">/Manufacturing</a> contains the files necessary to have an Agon light™ board manufactured, such as the Gerber file, Bill of Materials and Pick and Place file.
  <LI><a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/tree/main/Photos">/Photos</a> contains photos of a properly assembled Agon light™ unit, so to provide detailed references for those attempting to build one themselves. These photos can also be used by the media (feel free to do so if you are a journalist or tech writer).
  <LI><a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/tree/main/Third%20party%20documentation">/Third party documentation</a> contains what the name suggests: useful datasheets, user manuals, guides and application/technical notes of parts and software used in/with Agon light™.
