To order Agon lightâ„¢ units, you will always need the Gerber file, Gerber_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0.zip.<p>
If you want to order fully-populated boards, you will also need the Bill of Materials file BOM_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0.csv, and the pick and place file PickAndPlace_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0.csv.<p>
If you want to order boards with only the SMD parts already populated from factory, you will need the Bill of Materials file BOM_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0 NoTHT.csv, and the pick and place file PickAndPlace_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0 NoTHT.csv. This will require you to procure and solder the through-hole parts yourself<p>
If you want to order minimally populated boards, with only the two QFN ICs and the smaller parts reflow-soldered from factory, you will the Bill of Materials file BOM_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0 MINIMAL.csv, and the pick and place file PickAndPlace_PCB_AgonLight_R1.0 MINIMAL.csv. This will require you to procure and solder not only the through-hole parts, but also the three QFP ICs (U1, U2 and U5). See the <a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/AgonLight/blob/main/Agon%20light%20R1.0%20Manual.pdf">Manual</a> for more details.
