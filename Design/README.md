These are Agon light™'s design files.<p>
The schematics are provided as a separate PDF file, <b>Schematic_AgonLight_R1.0.pdf</b>.<p>
The <a href="https://easyeda.com/">EasyEDA</a> source files, with extension <b>.json</b>, are also provided above, for both the schematics and PCB layout. These can be imported directly into <a href="https://easyeda.com/">EasyEDA</a>, for maximum convenience, if you plan on re-using Agon light™'s design to develop your own variant.<p>
The file <b>AgonLight_R1.0_EasyEDA_Backup.zip</b> is redundant, and simply provides a ZIP archive of the <a href="https://easyeda.com/">EasyEDA</a> source files.<p>
Finally, the file <b>AgonLight_R1.0_Layers&Traces.pdf</b> contains a PDF illustration of the PCB layout.
